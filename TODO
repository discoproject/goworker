This is the todo list for the goworker project.  These are like the TODO notes
inlined in the source code but more general:

* Let the job options be expressed in the worker (e.g. saveinfo).
* Add more examples
* Add the pipeline worker.
* Implement handling of "more" inputs.  With the concurrent stages, Disco will sometimes send "more" to the
  go worker and this means the worker has to keep querying for more inputs (this worker is currently broken
  because of this issue).
